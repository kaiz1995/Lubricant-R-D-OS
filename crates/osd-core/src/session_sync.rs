//! Cross-device conversation sync, one JSON file per session (#124).
//!
//! Conversations live in the runtime's SQLite store under the app data dir, not
//! in the workspace, so a cloud-synced workspace carries files and no history.
//! Syncing that store as a file is not the answer: it is SQLite in WAL mode, and
//! file-level sync between two machines overwrites rather than merges it — the
//! failure mode is a lost database.
//!
//! The unit of syncing is therefore ONE SESSION, not one database. Each session
//! is mirrored to `<dir>/<session-id>.json`; a cloud drive is good at
//! synchronising many independent files and bad at synchronising one hot
//! database, and a conflict becomes a single conversation rather than all of
//! them.
//!
//! This module is deliberately thin. It shells out to the bundled runtime's own
//! `export`/`import`, because the format belongs to the runtime and any version
//! of it we re-implemented here would be a second, drifting definition. Three
//! properties of those commands were measured against the pinned 1.18.18 before
//! this was built, and the design rests on all three:
//!
//!   * `import` PRESERVES the session id — it does not create a copy.
//!   * Importing the same export twice leaves the store identical — idempotent.
//!   * Importing a divergent export UNIONS by message id, so two machines that
//!     each added different messages to one session end up with both.
//!
//! A running sidecar picks up an import immediately, with no restart, and
//! SQLite's own locking covers the concurrent access (the corruption risk is
//! file-level sync bypassing that locking, which is exactly what this avoids).
