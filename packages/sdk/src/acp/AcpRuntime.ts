// AcpRuntime: drive ANY agent that speaks the Agent Client Protocol (#14, #25).
//
// This is the second `AgentRuntime` alongside `OpenCodeClient`, and the point of
// the seam: the UI, provenance and run recording already talk to `AgentRuntime`,
// so "support Codex / Gemini CLI / Claude Code" becomes "configure a command"
// rather than "write another adapter".
//
// It takes a TRANSPORT rather than spawning the agent itself. The webview has no
// `child_process`, and the gateway web client (a phone) has no local process at
// all — so the child is supervised where the OpenCode sidecar already is, on the
// Rust side, and relayed here. Node tests inject a stdio transport that really
// does spawn one (`./stdio`), which is how this is verified against real agents.
//
// Everything optional in ACP is CAPABILITY-GATED, never assumed: the spec says
// a Client MUST check `initialize`'s capabilities before calling `session/list`,
// `session/load` or `session/delete`, and agents differ widely. So each of those
// has one code path when the agent advertises it and an honest fallback when it
// does not — see `supportsSessionList` / `supportsSessionReplay` below. (An
// earlier draft of this file hard-coded "v1 cannot list or replay"; that was
// read off one agent build, and both are stable v1 methods — codex-acp
// advertises `loadSession`, `sessionCapabilities.{list,delete,resume,close}`.)
//
// What ACP genuinely has no equivalent for, and is therefore honest about rather
// than faked: revert/unrevert, skills, archiving, and running a shell command
// outside a turn. Model selection is NOT in that list: `session/set_config_option`
// is v1's stable way to change a model, reasoning level or permission mode, and
// the options come from the agent (`configOptions`), never from our own catalog.
