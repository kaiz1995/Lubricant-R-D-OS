// Keep a damaged conversation sendable (#114).
//
// A session dies permanently with `Invalid prompt: The messages do not match
// the ModelMessage[] schema` when one stored part is missing a field the AI
// SDK's message format requires. The damage is on disk, so every later turn
// resends it and fails identically — the session is bricked, and no retry,
// restart or runtime upgrade recovers it.
//
// OpenCode fires `experimental.chat.messages.transform` on the very array it
// then hands to `toModelMessages` (`session/prompt.ts`: the trigger sits
// immediately above `MessageV2.toModelMessagesEffect(msgs, model)`), so a
// repair applied here reaches the model and nothing else. This restores the
// required fields in place, per request. It never writes to storage: the stored
// history stays exactly as the runtime left it — auditable, exportable, and
// untouched if the real defect is later fixed upstream.
//
// The rules below are derived from `toModelMessagesEffect`, not from shapes we
// have observed, and they deliberately leave alone everything that converter
// already repairs (interrupted tool calls, results cleared by compaction,
// `metadata.interrupted` outputs). The app's `malformedHistory.ts` reports the
// same set to the user; the two must stay in step.
//
// MUST mutate in place. `output.messages` and the array the converter reads are
// the same reference; replacing `output.messages` would repair a copy nobody
// looks at.
